# The Green Shield

The Green Shield is a forest fire prevention project that is carried out in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment. The objective of the project is to develop an early warning system that makes it possible to more accurately predict the occurrence of fires, in order to take preventive measures and reduce the damage caused by these incidents.

## Getting Started
1. Create a root element called reservations.
2. For each nature reserve, create a reserve element with the following attributes:
* Name: The name of the nature reserve.
* Province: The province to which the nature reserve belongs.
* municipalities: A list of the municipalities in which the nature reserve is located.
3. For each data you want to obtain, create a data element with the following attributes:
* Climate: Where we collect atmospheric data.
* Land: Where we collect land data.
